Continuous delivery is the logical evolution of AGILE principles. In this course, we'll teach you how to use the integrated tool set from VSTS to speed the development and delivery of your software applications. First, you'll explore what Continuous Deliveryis and how VSTS enables continuous delivery. Next youâ€™ll learn how to use Visual Studio Team Services to plan, design and implement powerful and reliable deployment pipelines. You'll take a look at different ways you can test a product and provide direct feedback on product quality. By the end of the course, you'll be able to use Visual Studio Team Services proficiently to build an effective Continuous Delivery pipeline to deploy an ASP.NET Core application to a Kubernetes cluster running on Azure.
